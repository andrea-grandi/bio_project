abstract = {Histopathological image analysis is a critical area of research with the potential to aid pathologists in faster and more accurate diagnoses. However, Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) present challenges for deep learning frameworks due to their large size and lack of pixel-level annotations. Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular approach that can be employed for handling WSIs, treating each slide as a bag composed of multiple patches or instances. In this work we propose Buffer-MIL, which aims at tackling the covariate shift and class imbalance characterizing most of the existing histopathological datasets. With this goal, a buffer containing the most representative instances of each disease-positive slide of the training set is incorporated into our model. An attention mechanism is then used to compare all the instances against the buffer, to find the most critical ones in a given slide. We evaluate Buffer-MIL on two publicly available WSI datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA lung cancer, outperforming current state-of-the-art models by 2.2\% of accuracy on Camelyon16.},

New breast cancer cases have surpassed lung cancer, becoming the world’s most prevalent cancer. Despite advancing medical image analysis, deep learning’s lack of interpretability limits its adoption among pathologists. Hence, a nuclei-level prior knowledge constrained multiple instance learning (MIL) (NPKC-MIL) for breast whole slide image (WSI) classification is proposed. NPKC-MIL primarily involves the following steps: Initially, employing the transfer learning to extract patch-level features and aggregate them into slide-level features through attention pooling. Subsequently, abstract the extracted nuclei as nodes, establish nucleus topology using the K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors, K-NN) algorithm, and create handcrafted features for nodes. Finally, combine patch-level deep learning features with nuclei-level handcrafted features to fine-tune classification results generated by slide-level deep learning features. The experimental results demonstrate that NPKC-MIL outperforms current comparable deep learning models. NPKC-MIL expands the analytical dimension of WSI classification tasks and integrates prior knowledge into deep learning models to improve interpretability.}
