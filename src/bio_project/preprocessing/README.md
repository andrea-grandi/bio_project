# Preprocessing

The `preprocessing` directory contains the code and instructions for preprocessing data.
We use [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM/tree/master) framework for extracting patches from the WSIs.

The final patches are in the `dataset` folder, devided into train, validation and test sets.
We use Roboflow for generating annotations about cells for each sets.
